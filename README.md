# DOP-XML: An Explainable AI Guardian for Digital Dopamine Regulation ðŸš€

**Our Mission:**  
To build an **ambient health guardian** that mitigates the risks of digital dopamine hyper-stimulation in children through **explainable, real-time AI insights**.

## The Vision: Answering the Call for an "Ambient Health Guardian"

> "Health isnâ€™t limited to hospitals or apps; it lives in our everyday choices...  
> What if there were a guardian that quietly walked beside us, nudging us toward better health without demanding our attention? Envision what that guardian could be."

**DOP-XML is that guardian.**  

In an era where digital platforms are engineered for maximum engagement, we are engineering a **counterbalance**: a system designed to protect and nurture the **cognitive health of the next generation**.  
We are turning **passive screen time** into an **actively monitored environment** for healthy development.

## Core Pillars & Innovations

What makes DOP-XML a winning solution is its foundation on **three critical pillars**:

### ðŸ§  Explainable AI (XAI) Core
The **"X" in DOP-XML** is its most critical feature.  
- We don't just provide a risk score; we provide **answers**.  
- Using techniques like **SHAP** and **LIME**, our system explains **why** it flags certain content or patterns.  
- Empowers parents and educators with **actionable, understandable insights** instead of black-box alarms.

### ðŸš€ Real-Time Nudging Engine
- The backend isn't just a passive analysis tool.  
- It actively provides gentle, **"ambient" nudges**:  
  - Suggest breaks  
  - Recommend alternative content  
  - Encourage offline activities  
- Helps **preemptively curb hyper-stimulation** before it becomes problematic.

### ðŸ”’ Privacy-Centric by Design
- Built with a **privacy-first mindset**, essential for applications involving children.  
- Roadmap prioritizes architectures that **minimize data liability**:  
  - Future plans for **on-device processing**  
  - **Federated learning** to ensure **user data remains secure**.

## Project Roadmap & Live Status

| Phase | Status | Key Objective | Next Milestone |
|-------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Data Annotation & Curation | ðŸŸ¡ In-Progress | Curate a high-fidelity, version-controlled dataset of video content labeled for dopaminergic stimulation levels. | Complete initial 750-1,000 sample dataset for baseline modeling. |
| 2. Data Engineering Pipeline | ðŸŸ¡ In-Progress | Build a robust, automated pipeline to preprocess and prepare video/metadata for model ingestion. | Finalize feature extraction script for YouTube metadata. |
| 3. Iterative Model Training | ðŸŸ¡ In-Progress | Develop and train a classification model, systematically improving accuracy from 89% to a target of >93%. | Implement hyperparameter tuning using Optuna. |
| 4. YouTube API Integration | âšª Pending | Engineer a resilient, rate-limited connector to fetch real-time data from the YouTube API securely. | Secure API credentials and build the initial fetch function. |
| 5. Backend Service & MLOps | âšª Pending | Containerize the model into a scalable microservice using Docker and expose it via a high-performance FastAPI. | Draft initial API endpoints and data validation schemas. |
| 6. API Definition & Documentation | âšª Pending | Define a stable, versioned API contract (`/api/v1`) with auto-generated interactive documentation. | Finalize the `/predict` endpoint request/response model. |
| 7. Frontend UI/UX & Integration | ðŸŸ¡ Designing | Develop a responsive, intuitive React frontend for data visualization and user interaction. | Build the first functional prototype for API connection. |
